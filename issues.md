# Delta Exchange Dashboard - Code Review
Version: 3.0.2

## Critical Issues

### 1. **Infinite Loop in Auto-Refresh**
**Location**: `main()` function, lines 380-385
**Issue**: The auto-refresh logic creates an infinite loop that will crash the Streamlit app. The countdown loop followed by `st.rerun()` will restart the entire app, which will hit the same countdown loop again.
**Fix**: Remove the countdown loop entirely. Use Streamlit's native `st.rerun()` with a simple timer or implement proper session state management to control refresh timing.

### 2. **WebSocket Client Memory Leak**
**Location**: `get_ws_client()` function with `@st.cache_resource`
**Issue**: The WebSocket client is cached as a resource but never properly cleaned up. Each session will create persistent WebSocket connections that won't be closed when users leave.
**Fix**: Implement proper cleanup in the WebSocket client and consider using session state instead of caching, or add a cleanup mechanism in Streamlit's session lifecycle.

### 3. **Missing WebSocket Dependency**
**Location**: `DeltaWebSocketClient` class
**Issue**: The code imports `websocket` but this isn't a standard library. The try-catch in `start()` method will silently fail if the package isn't installed.
**Fix**: Add proper dependency management and error handling. Either make it a hard requirement or provide clear fallback behavior.

## Functional Issues

### 4. **Inconsistent Error Handling**
**Location**: Throughout the app, especially in `safe_api_call()`
**Issue**: Some functions return `None` on error, others return error dictionaries. The error handling isn't consistent across the codebase.
**Fix**: Standardize error handling patterns. Either always return structured error objects or always return None, but be consistent.

### 5. **Cache Invalidation Problems**
**Location**: Multiple `@st.cache_data` decorators
**Issue**: The cache clearing with `st.cache_data.clear()` clears ALL cached data globally, not just the relevant data. This can cause performance issues and unexpected behavior.
**Fix**: Use more granular cache keys or implement selective cache invalidation for specific functions.

### 6. **WebSocket Data Race Conditions**
**Location**: `display_positions()` and `display_btc_mark_price()`
**Issue**: The WebSocket client's `_latest` dictionary is accessed from multiple threads without proper synchronization. This can lead to race conditions and inconsistent data.
**Fix**: Add proper thread synchronization (locks) around the shared data structures in the WebSocket client.

## Performance Issues

### 9. **Redundant REST API Calls**
**Location**: `display_btc_mark_price()` and `display_positions()`
**Issue**: Both functions call the REST API for BTCUSD mark price even when WebSocket data is available.
**Fix**: Implement a proper fallback hierarchy - WebSocket first, then REST API, with proper error handling.

## Code Quality Issues

### 10. **Mixed Responsibilities**
**Location**: `main()` function
**Issue**: The main function handles UI rendering, data fetching, WebSocket management, and application flow control.
**Fix**: Break down the main function into smaller, focused functions. Separate data layer from presentation layer.

### 11. **Inconsistent Null Handling**
**Location**: Throughout the codebase
**Issue**: Some functions check for `None`, others check for empty strings, others check for zero values. The null checking isn't consistent.
**Fix**: Establish consistent patterns for handling missing/null data and apply them throughout the codebase.


## Architecture Issues


### 15. **Missing Graceful Shutdown**
**Location**: WebSocket client lifecycle
**Issue**: There's no proper cleanup when the Streamlit app shuts down, potentially leaving WebSocket connections open.
**Fix**: Implement proper cleanup handlers and ensure WebSocket connections are closed when the app terminates.
